Configuring a File Storage Account with Blob Access

The objective of this project is to configure a file storage account with Blob access on Azure, enabling secure storage, management and controlled sharing of files in the cloud. This includes creating a storage account, setting up a Blob container, uploading files, generating a Shared Access Signature (SAS) for secure access and verifying functionality.

For example

Job Specific Scenario: Managing Secure File Sharing for Internal Teams

An IT Engineer, I was tasked with providing a secure method for internal teams to share large files, such as reports, backups, or multimedia assets, without relying on email or third-party services.

Why Use Azure Blob Storage?

Centralised Storage: Blob storage provides a centralised repository for all shared files.

Access Control: With SAS tokens, I can grant temporary, permission-specific access to files without exposing the storage account.

Scalability: The solution can scale as the organisation storage needs grow.

Cost-Effectiveness: Using Standard and Locally-Redundant Storage (LRS) minimises costs while ensuring reliability.

This setup enables me to maintain control over file access while facilitating seamless collaboration among teams.
